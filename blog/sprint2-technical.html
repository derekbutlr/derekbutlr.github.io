     <h2> What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? </h2>
    </div>
        <p> <strong> Margin is how much space is around an object. </strong>
          <br>
         <strong> Padding is how much space is within an object sides and it’s contents. </strong>
         <br>
         <strong> Border is between the margin and padding of an object. Only counted when given an actual width otherwise, it’s zero. </strong> 
        <p> What matters is defining width. If you have a house (x) metres long – (y) metres wide –  a garden and fence surrounding it- and you are looking at it from a birds’ eye view. You can imagine inside the house as the content, the garden is the padding, and the fence is the border.  
          A margin is the space outside of something, if you didn’t want the footpath outside your garden to be within an inch of your fence, you would give it a margin of 1 inch. 
           </p>

    <h1>What is a box model in CSS?</h1>
    <h2> The box model defines CSS dimension properties of an HTML element.</h2> 
           </div>
         <p>The <em>box model</em> is made up of four primary styling hooks: margin, border, padding, and width/height.
  <br>
      Think of it like a series of boxes (block-level elements) which contain, and can contain others which all have these properties.
  <br>
      When nested, the children elements such as div, span, h1, and so on—take on and are modified by the margin, border, padding, and h/w of their ancestors, and such is their placement.
  <br>
      A parent can define a style which a child can either inherit, or define itself.</p>

      <h2 class="centre">A little more clarification!</h2>
    
      <div id="marginauto">

<p><strong>Margin:</strong> It lies outside the box and is basically used to separate itself from other markup elements.
  <br>
<strong>Border:</strong> It is the border of our box, that also lies outside but before margin.
  <br>
<strong>Padding:</strong> Lies inside of the box, creates inner space in the box when used. It lies after the border.
  <br>
<strong>Height/Width:</strong> The dimensions of the actual box content and the amount of space that they take.
