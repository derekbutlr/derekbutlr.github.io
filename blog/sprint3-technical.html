		    <h2> An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS </h2>
			 	</div>
		<div>
			<p>You could think of <strong> HTML </strong> if you were writing a letter to a friend, just putting your text on the letter, with nothing else to spice things up. This gets the message across, but doesn't always appeal to the eyes. Add a few drawings, maybe change the writing to cursive & a splash of colour- there you have <strong>CSS.</strong> If you fill the envelope with glitter so when they open it they get a nasty surprise- there you have <strong>JavaScript.</strong></p>
			  	</div>									  
		<div>
			<h2> Flow Control and Loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (NOT THOSE) </h2>
				</div>
		<div> 
			<p>Loops mean that you don't have to type the same repeatedly to get the same result. <br> These are achieved by using <strong> if/if else/else </strong> statements (conditional) <br>
				'while' loops & 'do' loops <br>
				&& switch statements/label statements/with statements.
				A real life example of this being used could be something like
				if derek = tired 
					a(go to sleep)
					else
					b(<strong> keep studying </strong> because god knows you need it and this javascript stuff is really hard)
			</p>
				</div>
		<div>
			<h2> Describe that the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it. </h2>
				</div>
		<div>
			<p> The glue that ties everything together is called the <strong> document object model (DOM). </strong> Your DOM is an object representation of your entire workspace in your document. You can view the DOM through your browser & it represents all of your code in object form. Everything contained within the DOM is called a node- summoned by your browser. <br>
				Every HTML Element that you use has a javascript representation that backs it. By having an objrep you can not only access these elements in the DOM, but you can modify and create elements and add them while you work.
				This could be especially helpful for seeing your live changes as you work without having to switch windows all the time.  </p>
				</div>
		<div>
			<h2> Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects. </h2>
				</div>
		<div>
			<p> The value of an <strong> array </strong> is that you can use them to store a collection of data; an example of some of the types of data you could store in your array are: <br>
				- Booleans (True / False) <br>
				- Integers (A whole number not surrounded by quotes) <br>
				- Strings (something surrounded by single or double quotes) <br> <br>

				Arrays are defined in square brackets, and objects can be accessed with parenthesis or dot notation
				If you have 1000 different entries of wind pressure from a wPS, they would go in an array. Once they are in the array you can iterate over the array and do something on each element, and the same thing on each other element. However conversely, each <strong> object </strong> is representitive of one whole thing. Say for instance I as a person am an object, the data stored inside my object properties could be my eyes, height, age, etc. But they are all different sets of data so we may want to use them in lots of different ways.</p>
				</div>	
		<div>
			<h2> Explain what functions are and why they are useful. </h2>
				</div>
		<div>
			<p> <strong>Functions</strong> are basically reusable pieces of code (containing a set of statements) that have conditional go-buttons for when they are required. There are lots of built in functions (we learnt some, for instance console.log, alert) but we can also create them for just about anything, and then called upon when needed. For instance: <br> <br>
				function toCelsius(fahrenheit) { <br>
					return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);  } <br> <br >
					Is a function that converts Fahrenheight to Celcius, however you can also use functions as variable values: <br> <br>
					var x = toCelsius(77); <br>
					var text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius"; <br>
				<br>
				This saves us a lot of time in the long run, not having to repeatedly type the same things over and over again and allows us to create much more useful applications with our code. </p>
