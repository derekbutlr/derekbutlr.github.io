		<h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth</h2>

		<h3>How might you engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h3>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Don’t beat yourself up over your mistakes. Mistakes are one of the most important aspects of learning, and see it as another stepping stone to your solution. Without that stepping stone, you may have slipped and fallen into the river anyway! Positive reinforcement and encouragement go a lot further than stressing and convincing yourself that you cannot achieve these seemingly impossible tasks. You can do it.</p>

		<h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p>Some of the ways you can increase your own neuroplasticity is by making sure you are keeping up healthy habits such as: sleeping well, working toward your goal or purpose, reducing stress, improving diet, and the most important one: keep learning!</p>

		<h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
		<h3>There are two basic mindsets that we are aware of when it comes to learning:</h3>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><strong>The fixed mindset</strong> – where; You believe your intelligence is static; you may avoid challenges; give up when things are too difficult; see effort as pointless; ignore useful negative feedback; feel threatened by others success- this means that they may not reach their full potential if stuck in this state of mind. However, there is another mindset that is a lot more beneficial to our learning journeys, and lives in general- the growth mindset- where: We have a strong desire to LEARN!; embrace challenges as they come and see it as another step to learning; face learning as a level up; take criticism to brain; feels inspired by others success.</p>
		<div>
			<h3>How will you intedgrate the growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>When I started this course I was definitely in the fixed mindset. But I’ve been inspired a lot by some of the core work & especially this exercise. It’s really interesting to see how much we actually control when it comes to our own learning & its pace. As I struggle with JavaScript it is a little bit easy to slide into the negative mindset that I won’t get it, but just keeping the idea that once I actually overcome these big rocks of challenges I’ll be much better off for it- as it’s just part of the learning journey.</p>
