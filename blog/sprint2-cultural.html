    <p> # My Reflections - Sprint Two

      # Your Blog 
      
      ### Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple terms?
      Added an html placeholder (basic website structure)
      added the css index (where all of the styling is kept) 
      and then linked the two together (so the styling is applied to the html)
      (I later on moved the index file to my pages directory)
      
      
      ### Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?
      I didn't keep within the timebox, but I achieved the learning competencies. 
      
      
      # Learn HTML and CSS 
      
      ### What resources did you use during this challenge? Why did you choose those ones? 
      Google
      Stackoverflow
      Codepool
      Udacity
      
      I used these resources as I needed them a lot to understand things better. I put them into practice on my blog as I was learning them so they stuck in my mind a bit better. 
      
      
      ### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?
      Getting my CSS to work properly with my HTML was a mission. A lot of things just didn't work but sometimes it was because they were not linked properly with the html, or there was a typo in there somewhere. Also figuring out how I wanted my website to look and interact was a tough one. But just trying lots of different things and chipping away at it I ended up with a site I like a lot, but there is a lot of room for improvement. 
      
      
      
      ### What are of you proud of from during this challenge?
      My index page is super pretty. I learned so much about CSS having never tried it before and seeing it in practice and how effective it can be (despite how hard it is) is really satisfying. 
      
      
      ### Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?
      No not at all I went way overboard trying to fix little things.
      
      
      ### How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?
      I'd say quite a bit faster, but I might get caught up in trying out new things and go down another rabbit hole. 
      
      
      
      
      # Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge
      
      ### Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.  
      
      HTML TALKS THE TALK AND CSS WALKS THE WALK!
      Html is the content, CSS is the design and layout. You could maaybe think of our human dna as our basic HTML structure, and our individualism and core personality traits as our CSS! 
      
      
      
      
      ### What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them? 
      When nothing worked on my website - see below for that nice solution
      When I couldn't position my image correctly - I googled it 
      
      
      ### Any moments of surprise or joy? 
      When I found the missing bracket that was breaking my whole website and fixed it. That made me pretty happy. 
      
      
      ### If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?
      HTML could be a gorilla, because it's got a big body
      CSS could be a cat because it's pretty but it's hard to get it to do stuff
