     <h1> Sprint 2 Technical Exercise </h1>
     <h2> What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding? </h2>

        <p> <strong> Margin is how much space is around an object. </strong>
        <p> <strong> Padding is how much space is within an object sides and it’s contents. </strong>
        <p> <strong> Border is between the margin and padding of an object. Only counted when given an actual width otherwise, it’s zero. </strong> </p>
        <p> <em> The place where it all matters is defining width. Say you have a shoe box that is 12 inches long and six inches wide. No lid and you’re looking down into the box. Imagine the paper stuffing around the shoe. The shoe is the content, the paper is the padding and the box edge is the border. We’ll say the border is 1 inch so we can see the actual edge. Now place another box next to it, six inches away. That is the margin…the space between the two boxes. Still looking down on now two boxes, in CSS if you want to draw a container around both of those boxes, the width of that new container would be the:

    Width of the box 1: 6 inches+ width of box 2: 6 inches + the margin between them: 6 inches plus, border of box1: 1 inch on each side so 2 inches + another 2 inches for the border on box 2. Your width for the container wrapped around both shoe boxes would be:
    
    6 + 6 + 6 + 2 + 2 = 22 inches wide </em> </p>


    <h1>What is a box model in CSS?</h1>
    <h2> The box model defines CSS dimension properties of an HTML element.</h2> 
 
         <p>The <em>box model</em> is made up of four primary styling hooks: margin, border, padding, and width/height.
  <br>
      Think of it like a series of boxes (block-level elements) which contain, and can contain others which all have these properties.
  <br>
      When nested, the children elements such as div, span, h1, and so on—take on and are modified by the margin, border, padding, and h/w of their ancestors, and such is their placement.
  <br>
      A parent can define a style which a child can either inherit, or define itself.</p>

      <h2 class="centre">A little more clarification!</h2>
    
      <div>

<p><strong>Margin:</strong> It lies outside the box and is basically used to separate itself from other markup elements.
  <br>
<strong>Border:</strong> It is the border of our box, that also lies outside but before margin.
  <br>
<strong>Padding:</strong> Lies inside of the box, creates inner space in the box when used. It lies after the border.
  <br>
<strong>Height/Width:</strong> The dimensions of the actual box content and the amount of space that they take.
