    <h1> The Importance of EQ & IQ </h1>
    <h2> What's the difference? </h2>
    <h3> Why do they even matter? </h3>

    <h4> Emotional Quotant and Intelligence Quotant (EQ & IQ) </h4>

    <p> IQ is important. It's our ability to reason & problem solve and it affects our every choice throughout our day to day lives, and why we make them. 
        <br>
        It effects how we inerpret training, our general intelligence, and our ability to process information and use it. This could seem like the most important thing of all right? But it's not the only thing. </p>

		<p> EQ - <em> Emotional Intelligence </em> - is your ability to interpret others, their motivators & how to work with them. There are a number of categories that reflect your ability to do so - </p>

	<p> <strong> But they all </strong> have a number of <em> softer </em> skills within each category. The more emotionally intelligent you are, the more you will be able to flourish in any social environment- but that's just one part of it. It also plays a major factor in self discovery, your ability to focus and centre in on problems, and how you communicate and work with others. A high EQ paired with a high IQ is a fantastic recipe for success, and you can train your brain to improve either or both- however a high EQ seems more applicable throughout your life; despite how enticing a high IQ may be. </p>
