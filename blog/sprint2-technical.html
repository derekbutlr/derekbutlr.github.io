    <h1>What is a box model in CSS?</h1>
    <h2> The box model defines CSS dimension propterties of an HTML element.</h2>
    <p>The <em>box model</em> is made up of four primary styling hooks: margin, border, padding, and width/height.
      <br>
      Think of it like a series of boxes (block-level elements) which contain, and can contain others which all have these properties.
      <br>
      When nested, the children elements such as div, span, h1, and so onâ€”take on and are modified by the margin, border, padding, and h/w of their ancestors, and such is their placement.
      <br>
      A parent can define a style which a child can either inherit, or define itself.</p>
