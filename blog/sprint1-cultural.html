        <h1> Identity, Values, and Strengths </h1>
        <p> I was born in Auckland. As the youngest child of 5 growing up with just me and my mother, times were pretty tough sometimes. I got a laptop for my birthday when I was very young, and immediately started playing multiplayer games on it (runescape, wow, all the life-stealing ones!) and I spent the majority of my time on it. I really wanted to make my own runescape back then! </p>
        <p> Growing up we moved a lot. And I mean a lot. I went to two different primary schools, intermediates, and high schools. This shaped who I am drastically, for better or for worse. I met a lot of new people & gained a lot of life-long relationships, and it gave me more perspective about how important these relationships actually are. </p>
        <p>An experience that I would describe as a milestone of my life would be when I had the decision of moving with my mother or staying at my current location during the years of my 2nd high school. I chose the latter. I had had enough of shifting all around the place and wanted to focus on the relationships that I had- and myself. It meant that I was a lot more distanced with my family, but I retained and strengthened the bonds that I had with my pals.  </p>
        <p>It’s not something that I regret to this day as I have managed to maintain these relationships well despite living far away from everyone at this point!</p>
        <h2>Another experience would be when I tried out an automotive course. </h2>
        <p>I like cars & pretty much anything with a motor a <strong> LOT </strong>, so I thought it could be a good career! I quickly came to learn that once you spend all day working on other peoples’ vehicles & not your own, you don’t really want to go home and spend all night wrenching. I actually learned a lot in this course despite not wanting to continue in that line of work, and now I’ve got a bit stronger of an intuition for fixing things; having had a couple of project cars and bikes since then. Its more of a passion-hobby for me rather than something I want to spend the rest of my life doing- so I ended up dropping out after a few months. This gave me a bit of a push to start exploring career options and really think about what I would like to spend the rest of my life doing- it took me a while, trying out different jobs here and there- but now I’ve landed at Dev Academy. And I’m having a fantastic time learning. </p>
        <p>For an example of working with others I’d use when my pal and I had a shared project bike. I wanted it to have a black frame, he wanted it to have a blue frame. We compromised by flipping a coin! It was a little more fair than either of us choosing, and we were both happy with the outcome once it was painted.  </p>
        <p>One of my strengths but I’d say once of my biggest weaknesses is my preference to work alone. I haven’t really participated in many group projects thus far- although I’d love to! Since I struggle with communicating sometimes it can be a little difficult to get my ideas across, so I tend to just apply them myself. I’d love to work on improving in this aspect and I know it only comes with getting outside of my comfort zone. </p>
