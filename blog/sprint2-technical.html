    <h1>What is a box model in CSS?</h1>
    <h2> The box model defines CSS dimension properties of an HTML element.</h2> 
  </div>
    <p>The <em>box model</em> is made up of four primary styling hooks: margin, border, padding, and width/height.
      <br>
      Think of it like a series of boxes (block-level elements) which contain, and can contain others which all have these properties.
      <br>
      When nested, the children elements such as div, span, h1, and so onâ€”take on and are modified by the margin, border, padding, and h/w of their ancestors, and such is their placement.
      <br>
      A parent can define a style which a child can either inherit, or define itself.</p>

      <h2>A little more clarification!</h2>
    
      <div class="left">

<p><strong>Margin:</strong> It lies outside the box and is basically used to separate itself from other markup elements.
  <br>
<strong>Border:</strong> It is the border of our box, that also lies outside but before margin.
  <br>
<strong>Padding:</strong> Lies inside of the box, creates inner space in the box when used. It lies after the border.
  <br>
<strong>Height/Width:</strong> The dimensions of the actual box content and the amount of space that they take.
