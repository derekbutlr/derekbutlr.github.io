        <h1> Sprint 5 Cultural</h1>

        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
			<p>I would love to be able to create and design websites for companies in need that are a little out of touch from the modern world. That or if I have some sort of breakthrough idea making my own startup company and going from there!</p>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
			<p>My awkwardness may be a bit painful when trying to work in groups. That I might struggle with, especially if I'm a little behind- then it will feel like I'm letting the team down. As to my strengths, I'm pretty good at knocking out stuff when by myself or when pressed for time. </p>
        <h2> What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
			<p>Waking up every morning and walking to bootcamp.</p> 
        <h2> What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
        	<p>I'd like to get better at communicating my ideas with others.</p>
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
			<p>To do my best and show up every day.</p>
