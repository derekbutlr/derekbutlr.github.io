<h2>My Reflections - Sprint Two</h2> 



<h4>Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple terms?</h4>
<p>Added an html placeholder (basic website structure)
added the css index (where all of the styling is kept) 
and then linked the two together (so the styling is applied to the html)
(I later on moved the index file to my pages directory)</p>


<h4>Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox? </h4>
<p>I didn't keep within the timebox, but I achieved the learning competencies. </p>

<h3>Learn HTML and CSS </h3>

<h4>What resources did you use during this challenge? Why did you choose those ones? </h4>
<p>Google
Stackoverflow
Codepool
Udacity

I used these resources as I needed them a lot to understand things better. I put them into practice on my blog as I was learning them so they stuck in my mind a bit better. </p> 


<h3>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</h3>
<p>Getting my CSS to work properly with my HTML was a mission. A lot of things just didn't work but sometimes it was because they were not linked properly with the html, or there was a typo in there somewhere. Also figuring out how I wanted my website to look and interact was a tough one. But just trying lots of different things and chipping away at it I ended up with a site I like a lot, but there is a lot of room for improvement. </p>



<h4>What are of you proud of from during this challenge? </h4>
<p>My index page is super pretty. I learned so much about CSS having never tried it before and seeing it in practice and how effective it can be (despite how hard it is) is really satisfying. </p> 


<h4>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?</h4>
<p>No not at all I went way overboard trying to fix little things.</p>


<h4>How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?</h4>
<p>I'd say quite a bit faster, but I might get caught up in trying out new things and go down another rabbit hole. </p>

<h2>Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge<h2>

<h4>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.<h4>  

<p>HTML TALKS THE TALK AND CSS WALKS THE WALK! <br>
Html is the content, CSS is the design and layout. You could maaybe think of our human dna as our basic HTML structure, and our individualism and core personality traits as our CSS! </p>

<h4> What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them? </h4>
<p> When nothing worked on my website - see next question for that solution.. 
When I couldn't position my image correctly - I googled it </p>


<h4> moments of surprise or joy? </h4>
<p>When I found the missing bracket that was breaking my whole website and fixed it. That made me pretty happy. </p>


<h4> HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why? </h4>
<p>HTML could be a gorilla, because it's got a big body
CSS could be a cat because it's pretty but it's hard to get it to do stuff </p>

<h1> More sprint 2 reflections </h1>
<br>

<h4>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h4>
<p>I would love to work in network security or working to develop websites for companies that need it. It would be a great creative outlet and an awesome way of seeing my work flourish. </p>


<h4> skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
<p>I would like to work on expanding my creavitivity. I struggle with applying some of my ideas at times. Another thing would be working on my confidence, giving myself the push to put my ideas into practice.</p>


<h4>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h4>

<ul id="ulreflections">
<li>I am a fast learner</li>
<li>I'm pretty good at typing & spelling</li>
<li>I have a lot of free time</li>
<li>I'm not the best at communicating with others.</li>
</ul> 


<h4>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. </h4>

<p>I'll do my best to use timers so that I can efficiently work. Plan out the work I do and when I'll do it, and stick to that. </p>



<h4> commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h4>
<p>When I get stuck I google stuff and just try different things until something eventually works.
Stackoverflow is a great website for finding answers to the questions that many people haave already asked-
if I get super stuck and can't figure it out past then I may ask the foundations team for a bit of a push in the right direction. </p>


<h4> description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>
<p> <strong>Guidance!</strong> </p> 


<h5> scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.
These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated. </h5>

<p> <em>I have no other commitments aside from my girlfriend & pals who I discord. </em> </p>
