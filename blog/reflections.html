# Command Line Primer 
<br>
<br>
<br>
### In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?
<br>
The command line seems like a tool to use to get things done a lot quicker, and do a lot of things you normally wouldnâ€™t be able to do otherwise (pulling gits, pushing edits etc).although there is a bit more of a learning curve to using it than a GUI
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?
Yes I did.
<br>
<br>
### Name 5 commands you used, and what they do
cd: control directory - you can use it to navigate through folders
mkdir: make directory - you can use this to make a new folder
touch: you can use this to create a new file with your chosen file extension
del: delete - you can use this to delete something. -f may be necessary for it to work if an error is given. 
dir: directory - you can use this to list files in a directory once navigated to it
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Did you learn anything unexpected?
yes! I didn't expect you to be able to do so much with only the command line. without ever having used it before except for ipconfig. 
<br>
<br>
# Version Control with Git
<br>
Version control seems like a really good way of avoiding massive slip ups, it's a little bit tricky not mixing up git commands and cmd commands.
<br>
### Whats the difference between git and GitHub?
git is the version control system itself- whereas github is the website that hosts all of the repositories being worked on, so it is easier for users to connect. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Can you think of an analogy to describe them?
it's like having facebook for code vs coding with emails 
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Do you think you would still remember the difference a week from now if you didn't revisit the material?
I would want to use the material learnt so it sticks in my head a bit better 
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Did you stick to the timebox suggestions? If not, why not?
yes
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
# Install and Explore Git 
<br>
<br>
### What is a GitHub work flow?
the github flow is a non-commital, open way of experimenting with new ideas safely.
<br>
<br>
### What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?
I got pretty stumped when I couldn't figure out how to correctly set up my terminal with a text editor. I tried googling the problem for answers but didn't have any luck using other peoples' solutions, until I saw one about config files. From there I tried removing global settings to no luck, and then found that it was a local config file that was messing things up. So I cleared that and then set my chosen editor again- and it worked! This actually helped me put into action a lot of the commands we've been learning by having to use them over and over again so it kind of imprinted into my brain a little better- what they are and how to use them.
<br>
<br>
### Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?
I'd pay extra attention to the smaller details as missing those will cause a headache in the long run
<br>
<br>
<br>
# Track and Commit Primer!
<br>
I have kept running into unrecognized arguments and now see why. It is often just a simple spelling mistake- so recheck your commands carefully! 
<br>
### How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?  
Say you are writing your speech in class, and you've got some parts of it you are unsure of. You take these parts up to the teacher for review (staging branch) to see if they fit with the rest of your speech. If they say yes that's fantastic! - You will add them into the final copy of your speech (thus commiting them.) If not, take it back out of that staging branch and keep working on it!
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
# Branch, Pull, Merge
This is a great tool to allow working with others on a project pretty seamlessly. 
<br>
### What is Master?
The branch that is at the top of the tree. Or the top of the river- it is the most upstream so to speak. It's the best version of your project that you can create experimental branches off of without directly affecting it unless you want it to.
<br>
<br>
### Why create a Branch?
It's a great way to try out new ideas without messing with your already-working stuff that may wreak havoc if you accidentally delete something, so you can have peace of mind. It's a great way to collaborate with others too, with each of you working on different branches of the same master file that you can merge together when you are ready to- or nitpick beforehand if need be.
<br>
<br>
### Do the concepts introduced feel intuitive or difficult to understand?
It is a little bit tricky to wrap my head aroumd, but with the real-world analogies and good examples it's something I think I will get the hang of with further use.
<br>
<br>
<br>
# GitHub Fork & Clone
<br>
<br>
### What are some examples of when you would fork?
If you liked someones idea and wanted to add your own twist to it, with no chance of affecting their project. 
<br>
If you were a 3rd party working on software for a company, and they didn't want you to have direct access to their project then you could do your work on your own fork. 
<br>
If there was a repository intended to be used as a format, like this one.
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Write your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions. Describe what you did.
- Go to github.com & make sure you're signed in 
- Find the repository that you would like to work on
- Click the 'fork' button at the top right of the page
- Copy the link that pops up to your clipboard
- Navigate to the directory where you would like to keep that copy in gitbash
- Enter 'git clone 'copied url' 'chosen name' 
<br>
<br>
### Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
I didn't really understand the git push & pull and how important it was to check that you're using the most up-to-date version if you're working on a shared project. But the push and pull is literally that, pulling the recent version or pushing your own changes. If you're pushing to an older version of your project and someone has already pushed the same edit that you are it could cause some confusion. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
# Setup Repo & Create Blog
<br>
### Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?
During this challenge I didn't feel frustrated, the steps were pretty straightforward and by this point I'm making a lot less typos = less mind boggling errors 
<br>
<br>
<br>
### If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?
It isn't what I pictured but I didn't really have an idea of it before. I thought you just bought a domain and edited the html etc from there with coding magic? But the reality is a lot better because it's still magic- but it's learnable magic.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
# Thinking like a programmer
<br>
### Describe the process for solving problems
- Start your timer.
- Approach the question and see if you really understand it.
- Make a plan for how you will tackle it. 
- Subjugate your plan into doable chunks. 
- Begin tackling! Write the steps you take. 
- Get unstuck (coming back to the problem after some coffee can never hurt)
- Build on what you've accomplished & improve it. 
- Go over what you learned (Reflect)
<br>
<br>
### Will you follow that process? How?
I've been keeping a google doc separate to reflections that I've been putting up images where I get stuck, and trying to write how I fixed it afterward. It gives me a little bit more motivation to keep trying new solutions whenever I look at it! 
<br>
<br>
<br>
### What did you learn about flipped classroom?
It can be a little bit daunting when you are learning as you encounter problems, but figuring out how to solve those problems and applying it will give you skills that'll be useful -so you'll retain those skills- rather than stuffing a bunch of information that you don't need at the current time for anything in particular into your brain. It also means that everyone can learn at their own pace, while still getting the help that they need if they can't figure it out on their own. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
# Introduce yourself
<br>
### What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers? 
It was pretty nerve wracking. When I finally sent the message I felt relieved- but then I got immediately rekt by slackbot unexpectedly lol. It makes me more excited to meet everyone in person. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
### Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious? 
I was very self conscious. I didn't want to 'seem' any particular way but myself. But that's difficult because I am a bunch of different things! So I just did what felt natural and sent it.
